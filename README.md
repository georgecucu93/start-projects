# Welcome to My Web Development Journey!

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document my journey in learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This repository serves as a collection of all the projects and code snippets I create as I embark on this exciting journey into web development.

## About Me

I'm just starting out in the world of web development, eager to learn and grow. As I dive deeper into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'll be using this space to showcase my progress.

## What You'll Find Here

In this repository, you'll find a variety of projects and code samples as I explore different concepts and techniques in web development. From simple webpage layouts to interactive JavaScript applications, I'll be documenting it all here.
